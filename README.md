# Animals

1. Create application about pets. Every animal should produce its own sound and make different actions. Your application should take first argument as a name of pet and print its description. For example, cat says 'meow' and catch mice. Dog says 'woof' and protect house. Hedgehog says 'frr' and catch mice. Etc.
2. Build your application as one jar file
